            My name is Jeffrey Hover. I am a 4th year Computer Science major at the
            University of California Irvine. I've always loved playing games
            when I was younger but it was my junior year of highschool where I knew
            I wanted to learn and understand all about computers and how they worked.
            I knew after taking my Intro to Java class my senior year that coding was
            my something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Every problem can
            be solved; everything has a logical answer. Anything and everything has a
            solution. It just takes the right programmer to figure it out.

        <p>
          Each week I started with a fresh copy of a simplified x86 operating system
          and was given a feature to implement that the system was either lacking or
          to improve upon an already existing features
        </p>
      <li>
        <h4>Features Added</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy on Write(COW)</li>
          <li>Creating own syscall to display current memory usage</li>
          <li>Created a method of to allow the operating system
            to detect if a page has been accessed or not</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Features Improved Upon</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Max file size (From 268 blocks to 65803 blocks)</li>
          <li>Allow for multithreaded use</li>
          <li>Speeding up certain syscalls</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>Building a Simple Compiler</li>
    <ul>
      <p>
        As a partner project, we had to develop a simple compiler for the Crux
        coding language. The project was broken up into five key sections.
      <ul>
        <li>Parsing the input text</li>
        <li>Creating an Abstract Syntax Tree</li>
        <li> Assigning Types and Checking for Type Validity</li>
        <li>Creating a Linear Flow Representation</li>
        <li>Using the Linear Flow to Generate Machine Code</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </ul>
